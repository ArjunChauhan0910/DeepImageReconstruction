# DeepImageReconstruction
Data and demo codes for Shen, Horikawa, Majima, and Kamitani, "Deep image reconstruction from human brain activity".

## Data (fMRI data and visual features)
Under construction.

## Visual images
Under construction.

## Demo program
- DNN feature decoding from brain activity

We used the same methodology in our previous study (generic object decoding). 
Demo programs for Matlab and Python are available in [code/matlab](https://github.com/KamitaniLab/GenericObjectDecoding/tree/master/code/matlab) and [code/python](https://github.com/KamitaniLab/GenericObjectDecoding/tree/master/code/python), respectively.
See README.md in each directory (in GenericObjectDecoding) for the details.
